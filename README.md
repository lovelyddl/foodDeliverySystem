# foodDeliverySystem

A food delivery system app

Front-end: ReactJS and Semantic UI

Back-end: ExpressJS and NodeJS 

Database: MySQL

Our goal is to deploy it on a real server but at least we can build a localhost version first

1. Download the repository and understand our SQL structure, make any changes if necessary
2. Try to connect your app on your server to our MySQL database. If not, start from connecting our db to localhost using ExpressJS and NodeJS.

There should be a lot of youtube videoes doing that.
